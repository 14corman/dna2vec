# dna2vec

Our **dna2vec** is an open-source library to train distributed representations
of variable-length k-mers.

For more information, please refer to the paper: [dna2vec: Consistent vector representations of variable-length k-mers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06279)

This implementation has only been tested on Python 3.5.3, but we welcome any
contributions and bug reporting to make it more accessible.
